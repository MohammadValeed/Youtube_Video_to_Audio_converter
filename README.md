# Youtube Video to Audio converter

The provided Python script is designed to download the audio from a YouTube video and save it as an MP3 file. Here's a brief description of what the code does:

1. It imports the necessary libraries, including `YouTube` from the `pytube` library and `os`.

2. In the `main` function:
   - It prompts the user to input a YouTube video URL.
   - Determines the operating system (Windows or other) to handle file paths accordingly.
   - Creates a `YouTube` object for the given video URL and selects the first stream with only audio (ignoring video streams).
   - Downloads the audio stream to the current working directory or the specified path.
   - Renames the downloaded audio file with the video's title and changes the file extension to `.mp3`.

3. Depending on the operating system:
   - On Windows (`os.name == 'nt'`), it uses the `os.system` function to execute the `ren` command to rename the file from its original format to the desired MP3 format.
   - On other operating systems, it uses the `os.system` function to execute the `mv` command to rename the file.

4. The script is wrapped with an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, ensuring that the `main` function is only executed if the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

Overall, this code provides a simple command-line utility to download the audio from a YouTube video, convert it to MP3, and save it with the video's title as the filename.
